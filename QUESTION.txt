*The forest’s digital mist thickens as you wander deeper, your PokeGear flickering with static. A spectral verse lingers in the code—its meaning veiled, its subject unnamed. Only by unraveling the poem’s shadow can the sealed path ahead be opened. Let instinct and Pokédex wisdom guide you through the hush where echoes dwell. Speak the hidden name to awaken what slumbers behind Rotom’s final lock.


Beneath the hush where dead stars weep,
A hollow jest begins to creep.
No pulse, yet moves with hunger’s grace,
A shadow cast without a face.
It borrows shape from songs unsung,
And speaks in tongues of vapored lung.
Betrayed by joy it could not feel,
Now grins where light forgets to kneel.
